                <h3 class="subtitle">Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this report is to introduce the possibilities of soilless growing systems, within a small space at home, and how this system can be turned into something that is accessible, healthier, and one that brings opportunities for community-building and collaboration.</p>
                <h4 class="subtitle">Problem</h4>
                    <p>Food insecurity is a systemic issue that can happen to anyone, and has been on the rise in recent years. It is a result of a number of social, economic, and environmental factors including: poverty, unemployment/ underemployment, lack of access to affordable/ nutritious food etc. Ultimately, this has an effect on one’s overall well-being as the consumption of adequate food supply is a necessity for all beings.</p>

            <h5>Project Overview</h5>
            <p>Specifically in my neighborhood Woodside, Queens, 9.3% of the population was food insecure in 2023. In general, people will have to turn to churches, food pantries or food distribution centers to access food for daily consumption. In these centers, they distribute a variety of foods ranging from grains to packaged meat to canned goods. Most of these services are offered throughout the week and help alleviate food challenges that people may face.</p>

            <h4>Project Analysis</h4>
            <p>The lack of fresh fruits and vegetables from food pantries etc. can result from a number of factors and are not always something that we have control of. For one, as these food distribution services most likely rely on donations and have budget constraints, it can be quite costly to regularly supply fresh produce than non-perishable foods. Additionally, fresh produce require proper storage to maintain its quality.</p>
