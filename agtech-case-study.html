                        <p>The purpose of this case study is to introduce the possibilities of soilless growing systems within small spaces. What begins as a simple neighborhood observation can evolve into something accessible and healthier, while also fostering opportunities for community-building and collaboration. This approach brings us one step closer to a closed-loop food system—one garden and one system at a time.</p>
                    <h4 class="subtitle">Problem</h4>
                        <p>Food insecurity is a systemic issue that can affect anyone and has been on the rise in recent years. It stems from various social, economic, and environmental factors, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, and limited access to affordable, nutritious food. Ultimately, food insecurity impacts overall well-being, as access to an adequate food supply is a fundamental necessity for all people.</p>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Project Overview</h5>
            <p>Specifically in my neighborhood Woodside, Queens, 9.3% of the population was food insecure in 2023. In general, people will have to turn to churches, food pantries or food distribution centers to access food for daily consumption. In these centers, they distribute a variety of foods ranging from grains to packaged meat to canned goods. Most of these services are offered throughout the week and help alleviate food challenges that people may face.</p>

            <h4>Project Analysis</h4>
            <p>The lack of fresh fruits and vegetables from food pantries etc. can result from a number of factors and are not always something that we have control of. For one, as these food distribution services most likely rely on donations and have budget constraints, it can be quite costly to regularly supply fresh produce than non-perishable foods. Additionally, fresh produce require proper storage to maintain its quality.</p>
