                        <p>The purpose of this report is to recognize the construction industry as a practice and obtain construction skills that are valuable to apply to real world situations. The buildout of a small scale project has provided a guideline of the work ethic and culture of this industry. This hands-on approach enhances learning, improves efficiency, and contributes to a successful buildout of projects.</p>

                        <p>We had three construction days at the El Coqui Community Garden during the course of the program. During these three days we learned about various construction skills, tools and safety protocols from getting first hand experience on site. Additionally, on each of the three days we used different tools on different materials for a final build that will then be used by the community at the garden.</p>

            <p>This course has shown me the importance of being observant and how it enhances awareness and understanding in various aspects of life, both in practice and within my community. A single observation, when turned into actionable results, can have a significant impact in the long run. From sustainable farming to construction skills to technology, actively engaging with our surroundings and recognizing the nuances in our environments enables us to make informed decisions that contribute to the well-being of our communities and the world at large. Ultimately, cultivating this skill enriches our personal experiences and empowers us to drive positive change in society.</p>

            <p>Even though I have a background in architecture, learning about these tools on-site and in school were very different experiences. On-site, we had to implement our learning into actionable results, whereas in school, we primarily focused on understanding the tools' uses. My challenge was that it was my first time using all of these tools, which required some adjustment and time to get accustomed to them.</p>

            <p>In summary, these construction days initially seemed daunting, but with the proper guidance and skills acquired, we successfully completed our final build. From my experience, I think that for anyone looking to pursue construction as a career, it’s essential to complete the right coursework and have confidence in your abilities on-site. Taking a step back and exercising good judgment while working is a valuable mindset in this setting. Overall, I have gained useful construction skills that give me the confidence to undertake a simple project of my own one day.</p>
