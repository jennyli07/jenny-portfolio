                <p>This course has shown me how a small observation in my community can spark new possibilities. In this case study, the focus on health and well-being has inspired my system’s design, balancing simplicity with complexity. Throughout the program, I also recognized the importance of empathy in community-building—how small actions foster connections that extend beyond the immediate. Lastly, the site visits that supported our learning have given me more confidence in growing crops of my own.</p>

                <p>During the implementation of my project some challenges that I faced was that my initial site/ grow area was in a vast open green space in my neighborhood. Upon further planning and designing a system, I realized the scale of my project that it was heading towards, which was not as ideal for my concept at the moment. For one, it would be difficult to build and maintain within the budget and daily access to and from the space/ property may be challenging as well.</p>

            <p>I resolved this challenge by re-evaluating my design choices and the bigger picture and decided that starting out at the home-scale for now would be the best idea. I thought about the goods being distributed at these pantries etc. and the weight that it carries. So home-growing crops can help alleviate that weight to an extent. Therefore, I then took a look around my own home to figure out a system in the making as part of this case study and can hopefully inspire others to do the same.</p>

                <p>For my DWC system, I will be growing four Alpine strawberry crops, held in net pots—two in each 7-gallon water reservoir. The net pots will consist of the Alpine Strawberry seeds in the rockwool, a growing medium that supports plant growth. The plant roots, after the germination stage, will be submerged in nutrient-rich water inside the reservoir. Additionally, to provide the necessary oxygen, an airstone connected to an air pump will oxygenate the water. Lastly, above the setup, LED light strips will serve as a substitute for natural light, another crucial element for plant growth.</p>
                <p>Above the DWC system is the NFT system, where I will be growing Bloomsdale spinach crops. These will also be placed in net pots with rockwool, but they will be submerged in an NFT channel. Each channel holds a thin film of nutrient-rich water, which the plant roots absorb. Nutrients circulate through the system, flowing into the grow channel, and any unused nutrients return to the water reservoir, completing the cycle. This process uses an air pump, airstone, water pump, irrigation lines, and PVC pipes. Lastly, as with the DWC system, the NFT system will also require artificial LED lighting for this system build.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In summary, I would like to adapt my system into something simpler in terms of both build and maintenance. I am fortunate to have a relatively large space for my project, but I want to explore a smaller-scale design that can rejuvenate outdoor spaces or even brighten a corner space of an interior setting. In addition, to develop a system with a budget of $250. While this system is feasible, it’s crucial to understand the fundamental concepts of at-home growing systems prior build. In this case study, both the DWC and NFT systems are relatively simple hydroponic methods, but there are important details to ensure they operate as smoothly as possible. Overall, this study has not only expanded my knowledge of the current food system but has also highlighted how we can advocate for justice within it. I have gained a deeper understanding of my role as a designer in today's context, from neighborhood observation to transforming the food system into one that is accessible, healthier, and fosters community-building and collaboration—one system, one garden at a time.</p>
